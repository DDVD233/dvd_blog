# About me

I am a masters student at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science. I am currently in Stanford SVL and Partnership in AI-Assisted Care (PAC) Lab supervised by [Dr. Li Fei-Fei](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li/) and [Dr. Ehsan Adeli](http://stanford.edu/~eadeli/). 

Before joining Stanford, I graduated with the highest honor in Computer Science and Math from Emory University. I was in Emory Brain Network Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Carl Yang](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/), working on graph mining in the area of healthcare. 

Before joining Emory Brain Network Lab, I worked with [Dr. John Duncan](https://www.math.emory.edu/people/faculty/individual.php?NUM=392) on umbral moonshine and others. My work was primarily on determining the modular form trace functions obtained from the action of Spin(24) on V-supernatural.

My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Graph Learning, Bio-Informatics, AI in Healthcare, Interpretability, and Explainability.
