# About me

I am an undergraduate student at Emory University, majoring in Computer Science and Math. I currently in Emory Brain Network Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Carl yang](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) and [Hejie Cui](https://hejiecui.com/).

My research interests lie in graph data mining, with an emphasis on interpretable machine learning, graph neural networks and multi-modality learning.
